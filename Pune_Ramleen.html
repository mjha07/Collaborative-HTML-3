<p> - Pune was initially called Poona(As named by the Britishers) <br>
 - It is a small city in Maharashtra & is regarded as the satellite city of Mumbai <br>
 - It is the home to National Defence Academy, National Institute of Business Management, National Chemical Laboratory and many more. <br>
 - Back when we, as a country, had just gotten our Independence Pt. Jawarlahal Nehru termed Pune as the Oxford of the East. <br>
 - The main festival of Pune is Ganesh Chaturthi (Celbration of the birth of Ganesh). 
 - My neighborhood NIBM, Wanowrie have multiple high rise residential and commercial buildings. Earlier in the day my neighborhood was very calm and peaceful
 but with urbanization it has become one of the most busy parts of the city.<br>
 - In the US so far, New York is the only city whose commotion and hustle reminded me of home.<br>
